                                    Everyone experiences anxiety at one time or another. Feeling a little anxious
                                    is perfectly normal. Anxiety protects us and can help us cope with a worrying
                                    or perhaps dangerous situation. Anxiety is experienced as fear, the cause of
                                    which is difficult to pinpoint. This feeling is accompanied by symptoms.

                                    It is natural to experience a certain level of anxiety on certain occasions,
                                    for example when you are going through a major life change like marriage or divorce.
                                    It's also normal to be anxious the night before an exam, when going for a job
                                    interview, or during a sports event. The anxiety is then linked to particular
                                    events and usually disappears as soon as life returns to its normal course.

                                    chances of recovery.

                                    If your doctor prescribes medication for you, it is important that you take it
                                    carefully and follow the directions given.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    You also need to be patient before you get results. This is because it can
                                    take some time to restore the brain's chemical balance, sometimes 4 to 8 weeks.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Even if you feel better, you should continue the treatment as prescribed to prevent
                                    your symptoms from coming back.
                                </p>

                                    If you have any unwanted side effects from medication, see your pharmacist or
                                    doctor as soon as possible to discuss them. If necessary, your doctor may adjust
                                    your medication or recommend another medication.
